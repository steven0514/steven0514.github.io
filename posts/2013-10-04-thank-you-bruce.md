 I’ve had the pleasure to work with the IBM Collaboration Solutions app dev community since November 2008. After we established the [new OpenNTF organization](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/VSCN-7S2TPA), we could do many great projects for the community in the following years: app dev contests, webinars, XPages.info, XSnippets, CollaborationToday.info, new website, etc.

 Many different people have been involved in these projects, but one person has been involved in all of them – [Bruce Elgort](http://bruceelgort.com/). Bruce has been the chair of OpenNTF for the last 3.5 years and I’ve been lucky to work with him almost on a daily basis. In addition to the visible deliverables Bruce has done a lot of work behind the scenes, for example the work to get the [non profit status for OpenNTF](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/BELT-9BMJFF).

 Personally I’ve learned a lot from you, Bruce. Your motivation to deliver pixel perfect designs, your awesome presentation skills, your ability to moderate diverse groups of people and your focus on concrete deliverables are just some examples that really helped me in my personal development.

 Thank you!
