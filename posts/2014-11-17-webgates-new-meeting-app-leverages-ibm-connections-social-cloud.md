“goodmeeting.biz helps changing our meeting culture. Our Business-Application reduces the running of meetings to the maximum: Information, decisions and tasks. In a new, fresh and modern web style goodmeeting.biz is fully integrated into collaboration-environments such as IBM Connections in the SmartCloud or on premise. goodmeeting.biz allows to prepare and run the meeting, meeting minutes will be ready by the end of each meeting. And all tasks will be delivered to IBM Connections.”
