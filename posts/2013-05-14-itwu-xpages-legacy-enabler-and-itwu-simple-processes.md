 At the speedgeeking [session](http://dnug.de/dnug/dnugcms.nsf/id/3FBAEAA9EEEE0A29C1257A590055C458?Open&dl=DE) at DNUG Carl Goos from the German IBM business partner [IT works unlimited](http://www.itwu.de/index.html) presented two XPages based products.

 “The [ITWU XPages Enabler](http://www.itwu.net/enabler.html) … consists of several XPages components. Taking up only a few minutes of your time, these components enable you to transform your old Domino Legacy databases into new applications which can be accessed on any given web browser or smartphone.”
