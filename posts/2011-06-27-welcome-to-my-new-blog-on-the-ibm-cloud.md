 Yancy Lent just added my blog to Planetlotus (thx) and I saw that even my test entries from some days ago show up. So I guess it’s time for me to introduce this blog.

 I’ve created this blog to write about application development, mobile apps and XPages. While I write regularly on the [OpenNTF blog](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/FullArchive?openview) I want to use this blog to write about topics that are not directly related to OpenNTF.

 Technically this blog is hosted on the [IBM Cloud](https://www-147.ibm.com/cloud/enterprise/dashboard). I’ll document in the next days what I had to do to set this up. In summary it has been really easy and it’s amazing to have my own server somewhere in the cloud. My server runs IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.2 and I’ve installed the XPages Extension Library via VNC.

 My blog uses the out of the box IBM Domino blog template but I’ve extended it via OneUI and the Extension Library.
