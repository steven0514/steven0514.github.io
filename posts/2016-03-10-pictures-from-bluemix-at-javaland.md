This week David Barnes, James Thomas and I attended [JavaLand](http://www.javaland.eu/en/javaland-2016/) and presented [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/). As [last year]({{ "/article/03262015110541AMNHEDUL.htm" | relative_url }}) it was a very good conference with high quality sessions and we had a lot of great discussions with developers. Below are some pictures.

We demonstrated Anki Overdrive cars connected to Bluemix to [steer the cars via speech and gestures](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/node-mqtt-for-anki-overdrive).
