14 months ago my colleague David Barnes created the most viewed [Bluemix video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR_jDitw0Sc) (47k views). At that time BlueMix was still in beta, there was no Docker support yet and many other services were missing. Yesterday David published a new version of this video covering also some of the new capabilities.

The video also comes with subtitles which is helpful since we often play the video at conferences at our booths. Here is a picture from David at JavaLand this year that I posted already earlier. Notice the same shirt and gesture ðŸ™‚
