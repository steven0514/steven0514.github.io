 There is a new project on OpenNTF: [Lead Manager X](http://www.openntf.org/projects/pmt.nsf/ProjectLookup/Lead%20Manager%20X)

 IBM contributed this sample, more specifically Jo Grant and Craig Wolpert from the ISV enablement team. The sample is functionally similar to the lead manager application they did for the rich client for Lotus Notes 8.0. While the rich client version has been implemented as composite application this version uses the new Lotus Domino 8.5 XPages functionality to provide a web interface.

 Jo posted this video on [youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7onWF7rmBQ).

 Here is a screenshot of the entry page:
