In a previous blog post I demonstrated how to use the [XPages social enabler](http://heidloff.net/home.nsf/dx/11.12.2012081122NHEAFP.htm) to access IBM Connections. At the beginning of this month IBM released the IBM Social Business Toolkit SDK as open source on [OpenNTF](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/NHEF-92NHF9). The SDK is a general implementation of the same concepts that can also be used by web and Java developers. Weâ€™d like to consume this general implementation in a future release of the XPages extension library (typical disclaimer/no commitment).

In the video I describe how you can use the social SDK in XPages applications. In the last part of the video I explain the advantages of the two approaches as they exist today.
