 Since May there has been a new [IBM Collaboration QuickStart](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/29.04.2013080743NHE97V.htm) image available in the IBM SmartCloud. The image allows social business application developers to easily get started with IBM Connections and XPages development since it comes with IBM Connections and IBM Domino pre-installed and pre-configured.

 Today IBM [announced](https://www-304.ibm.com/shop/buycloud/americas/stores/servlet/ConfigLiteDisplay?storeId=11051&catalogId=10101&langId=-1&base=DT-CONFIG-TRIAL) a 60 Days trial for new IBM SmartCloud Enterprise customers. Among other [images](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/igs/cloud-development/contracts/SWG_Images_Only.pdf) this offer includes the “IBM Collaboration QuickStart for Social Business v2.0 64b”.

 You can use this image to participate in the [IBM Connections App Dev contest](http://connectionscontest.openntf.org/) where you have a chance to win one of five $1000 prizes.
