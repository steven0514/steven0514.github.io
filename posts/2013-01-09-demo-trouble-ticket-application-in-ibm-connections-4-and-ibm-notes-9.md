Here is a demo of a custom trouble ticket application which is integrated in IBM Connections 4, IBM Notes 9 and IBM iNotes 9.

If you want to know how we’ve built this sample come to the session “AD206: IBM Domino XPages: Embrace, Extend, Integrate” that my colleague Padraic Edwards and I will give.

Abstract:  
Come to this session to learn how to extend IBM Connections using IBM’s rapid application development platform XPages. XPages can be wrapped as OpenSocial gadgets and iWidgets and used on various IBM Connections pages and the new Embedded Experience. The same OpenSocial gadgets can also be used in e-mails and rendered in-line in future releases of IBM Notes/Domino and iNotes. Vice versa custom XPages applications can access IBM Connections and other social software easily by using an infrastructure called Social Enabler which simplifies REST API calls. With this technology, XPages applications can, for example, publish entries to the IBM Connections activity stream or access file in IBM SmartCloud for Social Business.
