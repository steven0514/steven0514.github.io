 At [DNUG](http://dnug.de/DNUG/cms.nsf/id/38Konferenz.htm?open) Mirco Vilic from [BCC Unternehmensberatung GmbH](http://www.bcc.biz/hp/bcc_hp.nsf/id/EN_Profile) showed me the new mobile user interface of their product [MailProtect](http://www.bcc.biz/hp/bcc_hp.nsf/id/EN_BCC_MailProtect). “MailProtect is an all-in-one solution for E-Mail Management in Lotus Domino environments. The software provides a configurable rule base system and value-add services to protect your messaging infrastructure”.

 The mobile app has been implemented using XPages and jQuery Mobile.

 Micro’s screenshot shows the iPad user interface with a suspicious mail that can now be deleted or released.
