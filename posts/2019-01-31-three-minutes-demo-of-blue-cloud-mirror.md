[Blue Cloud Mirror](https://github.com/IBM/blue-cloud-mirror) is a game where players need to show specific emotions and do specific poses. The game is a showcase of various IBM Cloud technologies.

Iâ€™ve created a short video to show how to play the game and to describe the main technologies that were used to implement it.

You can play the game [online](https://blue-cloud-mirror.mybluemix.net/emotions). All you need is a webcam and a Chrome browser.

Here is our Blue Mirror Cloud logo. As you can see, done by developers ðŸ™‚
