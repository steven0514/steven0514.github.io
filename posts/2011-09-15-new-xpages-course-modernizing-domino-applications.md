 Lotus Education offers a new XPages course: [Modernizing IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.2 Applications](http://xpag.es/?12E2).

 &lt;&lt;   
 This course is designed for application developers experienced with Domino Designer and XPages applications who need to know how to modernize existing applications to use XPages technology.

 By completing this course, you will have the ability to achieve the following tasks:   
 – Define modernizing   
 – Use best practices for determining what can and cannot be upgraded or modernized   
 – Compare architecture and design approaches   
 – Create a modernization plan for updating an application   
 – Update a Lotus Notes application to a modern application   
 &gt;&gt;

 The main author of this course is [Jeremy G. Hodge](http://www.hodgebloge.com/), a well known XPages developer in the community. I had the pleasure to review the course together with David Leedy and Per Henrik Lausten.

 There are also [three videos](http://www.youtube.com/user/LotusTraining#g/c/9E8D9B1D2BEB5E5E) available as preview.
