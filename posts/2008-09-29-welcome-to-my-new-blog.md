Hello everyone,

as some of you might know I haven’t published any entries in the [composite applications blog](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/CompApps) for a long time. I’ve been too busy with work and there have been some issues with the old blog.

Now however I have some time again and want to write about some exciting things I’ve worked on recently. I use now the Lotus Notes/Domino blog template which gives me a much better editor than previously and I don’t have the 24 MB quota anymore.

My goal is to at least publish one entry in the blog per week. I want to write about composite applications (big surprise) but also about other Notes, Domino and Expeditor application development topics. I hope that many people will read my blog and we will have interesting discussions here.
