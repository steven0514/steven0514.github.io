 During the summer IBM made a new image available in the [IBM SmartCloud](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/igs/cloud-development/#tab:overview/#leadspace:default). This image comes with Lotus Domino, Connections and Sametime pre-installed making it easy for developers to start building applications that leverage functionality of these products.

 Here is a quick overview of the architecture:

[![image](/assets/img/2011/09/DevImageSmall.gif)](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/DevImage.gif/$file/DevImage.gif)

 The following versions are part of the image:  
 IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.2.2   
 IBM Connections 3.0.1   
 IBM Sametime 8.5.1

 The image also comes with 85 user profiles from the fictitious Renovations Company, including names, email addresses, user photos, and more.

 The image is called “IBM Collaboration QuickStart for Social Business on the IBM SmartCloud Enterprise”. There is a [wiki](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpViewCategories.xsp?lookupName=IBM%20Collaboration%20QuickStart%20for%20Social%20Business) describing how to use and configure the system.

 To my knowledge the image is available for development and testing purpose and users are charged on an hourly rate. Please refer to the [IBM SmartCloud page](http://www-935.ibm.com/services/us/igs/cloud-development/index.html#tab:pricing-licensing/#leadspace:default) for more details.
