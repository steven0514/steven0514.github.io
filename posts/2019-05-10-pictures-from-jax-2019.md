This week I attended JAX in Mainz, Germany, which is a conference with 2000 enterprise developers. Below are some pictures.

In the opening session the people responsible for the [content](https://jax.de/programm/) described the main topics and themes of the conference: Microservices, microservices and microservices. Well, at least that’s how it felt like. Many of the sessions were somehow related to cloud-native, Kubernetes, service meshes, Java libraries to build microservices (for example MicroProfile) and Java optimizations for containers (for example Quarkus).

The session that Harald and I gave fit perfectly into this theme. We presented how to [build your first cloud-native applications with Kubernetes and Java EE](https://jax.de/serverside-enterprise-java/wie-entwickle-ich-meine-ersten-cloud-nativen-applikationen-mit-java/). Check out the [code](https://github.com/nheidloff/cloud-native-starter) of our sample app and the [slides](https://github.com/nheidloff/cloud-native-starter/blob/master/documentation/FirstCloudNativeApplicationsJava.pdf).

The keynote from Phil Estes fit into this theme as well. Phil gave a talk [Containers. Microservices. Cloud. Open Source. Fantasy or Reality for Enterprises?](https://jax.de/cloud-container-serverless/containers-microservices-cloud-open-source-fantasy-or-reality-for-enterprises/) which was well received. Check out his [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/PhilEstes/jax-con-2019-containers-microservices-cloud-open-source-fantasy-or-reality-for-enterprises).

We also had great conversations with developers at our booth. There was a lot of interest what IBM has to offer to build cloud-native applications and people liked the free Kubernetes cluster in the IBM Cloud to learn microservices, Istio and Knative. Here is a picture from our booth after the setup:

We also demonstrated our game [Blue Cloud Mirror](https://github.com/IBM/blue-cloud-mirror) again, which shows how to run AI in the browser and how to leverage IBM Cloud technologies like serverless, Kubernetes, AI and platform as a service.

By the way: The game has been played by quite a lot of people by now. My highlight is certainly Christian Lindner, the chairman of the German liberal party FDP, who played Blue Cloud Mirror a week earlier. I’m super proud of our team building this game and happy that it gets that much visibility!

Simon Moser and Julian Skupnjak gave another great talk [„Kube“ your Enthusiasm: Wie „Projekt Eirini“ Cloud Foundry und Kubernetes zusammenbringt](https://jax.de/cloud-container-serverless/kube-your-enthusiasm-bringing-cloud-foundry-and-kubernetes-together-with-project-eirini/). Julian published the [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/herrjulz/kube-your-enthusiasm). The visualizations are really good.

Additionally Steve Poole gave two talks [Java Serialisation: a modern Fairytale](https://jax.de/core-java-jvm-languages/java-serialisation-a-modern-fairytale/) and [An open Future for Java in the Cloud?](https://jax.de/core-java-jvm-languages/an-open-future-for-java-in-the-cloud/) Theresa Mammarella had a session [Migrate early, migrate often! JDK release Cadence Strategies](https://jax.de/core-java-jvm-languages/migrate-early-migrate-often-jdk-release-cadence-strategies/). Check out her [slides](https://github.com/theresa-m/migrateearly-demo/blob/master/migrateearly.pdf).

Miriam collected all tweets with more pictures related to IBM and JAX in a [Twitter moment](https://twitter.com/Jessieevaline/status/1126151852154814464).
