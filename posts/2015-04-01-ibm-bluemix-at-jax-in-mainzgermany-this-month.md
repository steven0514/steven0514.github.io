From April 20th until April 23th the [JAX](https://jax.de/2015/) conference will take place in Main, Germany. I have never attended this conference but heard many good things about it. We will present [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) in sessions and at our booth.

JAX describes itself as “the leading conference for enterprise technology, software architecture, agility and Java in Europe”. It’s a technical conference covering various topics: Java, Enterprise, Web Technologies, Engineering, Mobile, Internet of Things, Agile, Architecture, Big Data. Last year they’ve had more than 2000 attendees and more than 200 high quality sessions. Check out this year’s [agenda](https://jax.de/2015/sessions).

My colleague David Barnes will do a keynote on Tuesday 04/21 at 2:15 PM and a second session about big data on Tuesday 04/21 at 11:45 PM.
