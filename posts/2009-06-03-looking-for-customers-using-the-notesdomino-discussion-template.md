 As I wrote about earlier in this [blog entry](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/heidloffblog.nsf/dx/14.05.2009025704NHEA6R.htm) I’d like to extend the discussion template. I’m looking for customers, partners or other developers who are either using discussion databases heavily and/or have extended the discussion template to help prioritizing the new functionality.

As you can read in the previous blog entry we could do exciting things. Better extensibility, modern rich client UI, better feed support and integrations of custom user profiles are some examples for possible new features.

If you are interested to provide feedback, I’d appreciate if you could contact me directly (niklas\_heidloff at de dot ibm dot com).
