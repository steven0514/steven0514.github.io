 Paul Hannan and Tony McGuckin from the IBM XPages development team have posted a new project to OpenNTF: [Profiles application based on XPages](http://openntf.org/internal/ontfcatalog.nsf/topicThread.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=356D22E520F366C38525758C0029F74A).

 You can run this [application live](http://openntf.org/demos/profiles.nsf).

 Here is a screenshot:

 See [here to get a detailed description](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/LS09_SHOW106.htm) how this application was built.

 The application itself is a profiles type application similar in many ways to a contacts list. It allows the user to create a new profile document, search for existing profiles aided by Ajax type ahead and view filtering, add ‘friends’ to their own profile, as well as many other features.
