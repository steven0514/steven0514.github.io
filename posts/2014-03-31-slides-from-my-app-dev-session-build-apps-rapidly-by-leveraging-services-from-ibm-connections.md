Abstract: “Don’t reinvent the wheel when building your own apps. Instead use the services provided by IBM Collaboration Solutions and focus on your specific business requirements. IBM Collaboration Solutions provide an unique set of social and collaborative services like profiles, file sharing, community discussions and much more. Come to this session to see different types of apps, e.g. XPages apps, that have been developed rapidly by leveraging these services from IBM Connections–on premises or in the cloud. Technically the services can be easily accessed from apps via the IBM Social Business Toolkit SDK. In this session you’ll learn how the SDK simplifies calling the back-end services via APIs and how reusable user interface controls can leveraged.”
