As readers of my blog will know, I want to learn more about machine learning. I’ve managed to run some samples and I’ve built my own first little samples. It feels like the next step is to understand more about the different algorithms, for example when to pick which one and how to tune the parameters to achieve the best results.

To learn more, I’ve started to watch the first hours of the awesome courses below. The courses are a great introduction to machine learning and very different from most other videos I found which often seem to assume you are already a data scientist.

The courses are free courses provided by [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com). The speakers are phenomenal, the content is very interesting and easy to understand.

To run the exercises in the courses via [Scikit Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) on [Bluemix](https://bluemix.net) you can follow the documentation in this [article]({{ "/article/how-to-get-started-machine-learning-bluemix" | relative_url }}).
