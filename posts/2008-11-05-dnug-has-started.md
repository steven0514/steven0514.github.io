 Brent Peters and Kevin Cavanaugh just started with their opening keynote speech: [http://www.dnug.de/DNUG/cms.nsf/id/29KonfAgenda411.htm ](http://www.dnug.de/DNUG/cms.nsf/id/29KonfAgenda411.htm)  
 Reiner Gratzfeld said there are more than 300 attendees.

 Iâ€™ll post more about it later.   
 Update: I wanted to write more but just saw that Paul Mooney has already blogged about everything that Brent and Kevin talked about in the keynote: <http://www.pmooney.net/pmooney/pmooneynet.nsf/d6plinks/PMOY-7L3CKQ>
