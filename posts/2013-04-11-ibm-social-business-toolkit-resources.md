 Below is an overview of the new IBM Social Business Toolkit and a list of resources.

 IBM Social Business Toolkit – Overview

 The IBM Social Business Toolkit is your single source for developing integrations and leveraging IBM Connections and IBM SmartCloud for Social Business. The toolkit provides a set of extensible tools and resources for developers who want to incorporate social capabilities into their applications and business processes. Watch this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Wwa_5WJaE) for an overview of the SDK.

 Social Business Toolkit SDK   
 The [Social Business Toolkit SDK](http://ibmsbt.openntf.org/) lets Web, Java and XPages developers easily access IBM Connections and IBM SmartCloud for Social Business. It can be run on several Java application servers like WebSphere Application Server, Tomcat, WebSphere Portal, and Domino. The SDK provides easy to use JavaScript and Java APIs that encapsulate authentication mechanisms like OAuth, avoid JSON and Atom parsing, and abstract the specific target environments.

 Social Business Toolkit Playground and API Explorer   
 The [SBT Playground](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/Home.xsp) is a web-based live demonstration of the JavaScript APIs that are exposed by the SDK. The Playground contains a large set of code snippets and examples that you can customize and use in your own applications. The Playground also comes with an integrated API explorer and API documentation. [Try](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/Home.xsp) the Playground on IBM Greenhouse.

 API Documentation   
 The [IBM Social Business Development Wiki](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&content=catcontent&ct=prodDoc) contains the documentation of the SDK, for example the [Java API](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=SDK_Java_Reference_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) documentation and the [JavaScript API](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=SDK_JavaScript_Reference_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) documentation.

 News   
[Collaboration Today](http://collaborationtoday.info/) is a news aggregator for IBM Collaboration Solutions professionals covering news about various IBM products like IBM Connections, IBM SmartCloud and IBM Domino. Read [news](http://collaborationtoday.info/ct.nsf/home.xsp?filter=cnxdev) about IBM Connections app dev and [news](http://collaborationtoday.info/ct.nsf/home.xsp?filter=xpages) about XPages.

 IBM Social Business Toolkit – Get Started

 Get Started   
 Watch this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4Wwa_5WJaE) for a short overview of the SDK or watch this longer [video](http://livestre.am/4jFai) to learn about the IBM Collaboration Solutions app dev strategy. Then try out the [Playground](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/Home.xsp) to see simple JavaScript samples running live against IBM Connections on IBM Greenhouse or watch the samples that come with the SDK in another [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVn3i-hBto8#!). There is also a [quick start image](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=IBM_Collaboration_QuickStart_for_Social_Business_sbt&content=pdcontent) in the IBM SmartCloud available for developers which comes with IBM Connections, IBM Domino, test user accounts, the SDK and other components preinstalled and preconfigured.

 Get Started as HTML Developer   
 The SDK can be used to develop client side HTML and JavaScript code to access IBM Collaboration Solutions services without having to write any server side logic. As a JavaScript developer you can write and test your code via the [Playground](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/Home.xsp). Read the [JavaScript API](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=SDK_JavaScript_Reference_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) documentation to learn about the available functionality and check out the [IBM Social Business Development Wiki](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&content=catcontent&ct=prodDoc) for more details.

 Get Started as Java Developer   
 The SDK can be used from Java code running on various Java application servers. Read the [Java API](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=SDK_Java_Reference_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) documentation to learn about the available functionality and check out the [IBM Social Business Development Wiki](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&content=catcontent&ct=prodDoc) for more details. Watch this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx4x1gkIPWE) to see how to set up the Java development environment. There is also a simple [tutorial](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=Creating_your_first_J2EE_application_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) describing how to build your first J2EE app using the SDK and there is material available from [workshops](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/dx/IBM_Social_Business_App_Dev_Workshop_Labs) which guides developers in detail through the capabilities of the SDK.

 Get Started as XPages Developer   
 The SDK can also be used from [XPages](http://xpages.info/) applications to access IBM Collaboration Solutions services. Check out this [deck](http://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/ibm-connect-ad206-ibm-domino-xpages-embrace-extend-integrate) for a description how to set up and use the SDK. Read the [Java API](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&res_title=SDK_Java_Reference_SDK1.0&content=pdcontent) documentation to learn about the available functionality and check out the [IBM Social Business Development Wiki](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/appdevwiki.nsf/xpDocViewer.xsp?lookupName=IBM+Social+Business+Toolkit+SDK+documentation#action=openDocument&content=catcontent&ct=prodDoc) for more details.
