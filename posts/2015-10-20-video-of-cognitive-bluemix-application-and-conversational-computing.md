Earlier this month Ginni Rometty spoke about the importance of cognitive computing and IBM’s bet on the the [Cognitive Era](http://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/ibm-bets-on-the-cognitive-era/). Cognitive computing enables more natural interactions of people with technology, cognitive computing is intelligent turning raw data into information considering contexts like user intentions, locations and preferences and cognitive computing allows people to discover important information quickly based on a big set of available data. In other words: Cognitive computing empowers individuals to be more productive.

Last week at the [O’Reilly Velocity Conference in New York](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS53WFY_k3E) my manager [David Boloker](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-boloker/0/1b/706) gave a keynote where he demonstrated a really cool cognitive application. David is the CTO of IBM’s Emerging Internet Technology group and leads among many other things our team of Bluemix developer advocates. The application “Day in a Life” uses conversational computing to find all sorts of personal and business relevant information. Technically [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net) is used and various services like speech recognition, sentiment analysis, text to speech, Internet of Things and more.
