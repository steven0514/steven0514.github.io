 Last weekend the [DeveloperWeek Hackathon](http://developerweek.com/hackathon/) took place in San Francisco. It’s a big hackathon with 500 developers and more than 30 different sponsors who run their separate challenges. IBM sponsored the [IBM Bluemix Challenge](http://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/developerweek-hackathon-ibm-bluemix-challenge) where developers could win prizes with a total value of $6000.

 Below are some pictures from the hackathon. I’ll blog separately about the winning projects.

 The DeveloperWeek organizers and the sponsors describe the logistics of the hackathon.
