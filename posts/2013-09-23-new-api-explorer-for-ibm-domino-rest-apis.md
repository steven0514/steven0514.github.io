 There is a new API explorer for the Domino REST APIs integrated in the Playground on IBM Greenhouse. The screenshot shows in the left column the different REST APIs and in the main area the result of “/api/data”.

 You can [try](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/sbtplayground.nsf/Explorer.xsp) the API explorer live by following these steps. First choose “Domino on Greenhouse” as your environment in the upper right corner.

 Then choose a REST API in the left navigator, e.g. “Database collection”, and click on the “Get” symbol to expand the explorer. Before you can execute the call you need to log in to Greenhouse.

 You can also use the explorer against your own Domino servers by downloading it from [OpenNTF](http://ibmsbt.openntf.org/) and installing it locally.
