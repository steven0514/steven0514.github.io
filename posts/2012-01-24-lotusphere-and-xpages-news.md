 I’ll be working most of my time at the [OpenNTF booth](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/BELT-8QE2A7).

 There are also more than 20 other [XPages sessions](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/lotus/events/conference/content/sessions/appdev.html).

 This week David Leedy announced a new [XPages Cheat Sheet](http://notesin9.com/index.php/2012/01/06/coming-to-lotusphere-a-new-xpages-cheatsheet/) which will be handed out at Lotusphere. Thanks a lot, David, for your help.

 There is a new redbook wiki available: [Lotus Domino Development Best Practices](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/new-redbooks-wiki-lotus-domino-development-best-practices)

 Nathan Freeman just posted a new project on OpenNTF: [XPages SDK for Eclipse RCP](http://ntf.gbs.com/nathan/escape.nsf/d6plinks/NTFN-8QE8K9). This project in combination with his other project [XPages Starter Kit](http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/project.xsp?action=openDocument&name=XSP%20Starter%20Kit) are a great help to get started with Eclipse Java programming to write your own extension libraries. If you are interested you should also check out the [Simple Samples for XPages Extensibility](http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/project.xsp?action=openDocument&name=Simple%20Samples%20for%20XPages%20Extensibility) and the [Debug Plugin](http://xpag.es/?14FE).

 I also like Stephan Wissel’s blog entry [Learning XPages](http://www.wissel.net/blog/d6plinks/Learning-XPages?Open&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Wisselnet+%28wissel.net%29).

 TLCC and GBS have published a great video [Mobilize Your XPages Applications with the IBM Upgrade Pack](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=k6Da_TvlZ1s).

 Hope to see many of you at Lotusphere.
