 I like the effort from IBM to outreach to new developers which includes attending many non-IBM hosted conferences, offering programs particularly for startups, hackathons, university programs and more. Below are two ads I saw recently in German magazines.

This ad was published in [‘Der Spiegel’](http://www.spiegel.de/), a German news magazine.

And this ad is from the German [Javamagazin](https://jaxenter.de/magazine/java-magazin).
