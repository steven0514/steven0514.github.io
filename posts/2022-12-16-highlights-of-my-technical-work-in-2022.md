2022 has been another fun year for me! I’ve had the pleasure to work with so many smart people and I’ve been able to learn a lot. Below is a quick summary of my technical work.

The goal of our organization is to make IBM partners successful. To scale our work, we have produced a number of re-usable assets and helped to make IBM Software easier to embed. Compared to my previous work as developer advocate the focus has been on production ready assets and offerings.

Additionally I’ve taken some education courses provided by IBM.

Thanks a lot to my managers, my colleagues and IBM. I appreciate that IBM keeps giving me the opportunity to work with these state of the art technologies. The outlook for next year looks promising too!
