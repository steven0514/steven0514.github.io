 “Through the global program, qualifying startups will receive up to $120,000 worth of credits to put towards IBM Cloud usage, giving them the instant infrastructure needed to quickly launch their businesses and focus resources on coding, building, scaling and bringing innovations to market.”

 “Entrepreneurs will be given access to the entire IBM Cloud portfolio built on cloud infrastructure from SoftLayer, an IBM company. This portfolio includes Bluemix, IBM’s cloud platform for app development with more than 75 runtimes and services.”
