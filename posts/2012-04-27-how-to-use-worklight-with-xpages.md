 In my last [blog entry](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/19.04.2012143734NHEGTK.htm) I mentioned that I want to publish instructions for how to use XPages in [Worklight](http://www.worklight.com/).

 “It is currently not supported to point the Worklight app against a remote web server, e.g. an XPage. However this is important so that XPages developers can continue to use Domino Designer and the XPages mobile controls to build the web parts of their apps. The Worklight team is aware of this requirement. I spent some time to figure out what changes need to be done to the Worklight app to make this work (at least for simple scenarios) so that XPages developers can start playing with Worklight. I’ve created a video with instructions that I’d like to publish soon.”

 So here is the video. Again, please note that this is not a supported configuration at this point and I don’t have answers regarding licensing yet.
