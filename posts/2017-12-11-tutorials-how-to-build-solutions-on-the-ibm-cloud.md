In addition to [Patterns]({{ "/article/ibm-journeys-developers" | relative_url }}) and [How-Tos]({{ "/article/watson-conversation-inspector-rest" | relative_url }}) there is another good resource for developers to learn how to use the IBM Cloud. The [Solution Tutorials](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/tutorials/index.html#tutorials) provide step-by-step instructions on how to implement common patterns based on best practices and proven technologies.

I like these tutorials for several reasons:

- They cover typical scenarios many developers need to understand when getting started with the IBM Cloud.
- They are well written and easy to follow. Every tutorial is one page with all the content you need to know and no noise.
- The tutorials are easy to find since they are part of the IBM Cloud documentation and you can help improving them since the IBM Cloud documentation source is on [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix-Docs/tutorials).

Here are some of my favorite tutorials.

**Deploy a scalable web application on Kubernetes**  
“This tutorial walks you through how to scaffold a web application, run it locally in a container, and then deploy it to an IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, we’ll show you how to bind a custom domain, monitor the health of the environment, and scale.”

**Serverless Web Application and API**  
“In this tutorial, you will create a serverless web application by hosting static website content on GitHub Pages and implementing the application backend using Functions on IBM Cloud.”

**Mobile application with a serverless backend**  
“In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Cloud Functions along with Cognitive and Data services to build a serverless backend for a mobile application. The application shown in this tutorial is a feedback app that smartly analyses the tone of the feedback text and appropriately acknowledges the customer through a Push Notification.”

**Accelerate delivery of static files using a CDN**  
“This tutorial walks you through how to host and serve website assets (images, videos, documents) and user generated content in a Cloud Object Storage, and how to use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for fast and secure delivery to users around the world.”
