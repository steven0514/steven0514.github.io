 This week Iâ€™m attending [CeBIT](http://www.cebit.de/home) in Hannover, Germany. Below are some pictures, especially about everything related to [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/).

 IBM has a huge showcase area in hall 2 covering cloud, Watson, mobile and many other topics.

 This is a picture my colleague Tristan Reckhaus took from one of my sessions as part of the [Developer World](http://developerworld.heise.de/en/), the new meeting point for developers.

 There are multiple booths where Bluemix is presented. This one is in hall 11 for startups where Martha Cieslinska, Harald Uebele and I worked.

 On Tuesday evening there were two parties sponsored by IBM Bluemix. This picture is from the first one directly after the expo.

 To get free drinks we gave out Bluemix dollars.
