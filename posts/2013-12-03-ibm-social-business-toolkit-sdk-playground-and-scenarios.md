Last week I presented the [IBM Social Business Toolkit SDK](https://www.ibmdw.net/social/#socialapps) to some partners and customers. In this session I focussed on scenarios to describe the value when using IBM Connections and the SDK to build social apps and I focussed on the simple JavaScript samples in the [playground](https://greenhouse.lotus.com/sbt/SBTPlayground.nsf/JavaScriptSnippets.xsp) which help developers to get started quickly.

Below are my slides. On slides 9ff you can find a preview of a new version of the playground that we’d like to publish soon. To demo the playground I used the “my communities” sample in several variations: on prem vs cloud, oneui and bootstrap, API vs REST vs UI control and a custom template for an UI control.
