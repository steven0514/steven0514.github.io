 At [code.talks](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=01.10.2015101241NHEBMY.htm) I gave a session [Rapid Application Development in the Cloud and On-Premises with Docker](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/rapid-application-development-in-the-cloud-and-on-premises-with-docker). Below is the recording of my German session.

 You can find my [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/rapid-application-development-in-the-cloud-and-onpremises-with-docker) on Slideshare and other session recordings on the [code.talks YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfuj1MM5p37CRzWYPv_PsWA/videos).

 The location of the conference was a cinema and my colleague Jonathan Kaufman explains why all [developer conferences should be held in cinemas](http://www.jkaufman.io/why-all-developer-conferences-should-be-held-in-a-cinema/).
