Tomorrow, Wednesday January 21st, my colleague Tristan Reckhaus and I will give a Bluemix webinar. Tristan will explain why IBM Bluemix is especially interesting for startups.

After this I’ll demonstrate how to create, deploy, modify and re-deploy a simple Bluemix application, similarly to the video below.

[Register for the webinar](http://www.eventbrite.com/e/ibm-bluemix-webinar-tickets-15177270625), it’s open and free for everyone and organized by [Hamburg-Startups](http://www.hamburg-startups.net/ueber-uns/). To my knowledge it will be in English even though the [interview](http://www.hamburg-startups.net/ibm-bluemix-webinar-fuer-startups/) was in German.
