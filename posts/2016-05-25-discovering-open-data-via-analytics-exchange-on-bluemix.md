As I’m trying to learn more about machine learning I spent some time to look for data that I can use. While GitHub is the place to get open source code, there doesn’t seem to be a counterpart for open data. Below are a couple of websites that help finding data.

In [Bluemix](https://bluemix.net) there is an [Analytics Exchange](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/data/exchange/public/) which gives you access to free and open data in categories such as economy and business, leisure, transportation, and others. The screenshot shows a sample dataset which contains reviews from Airbnb.

There are several other websites that help finding datasets. Unfortunately a lot of datasets are not open. So don’t forget to check the licenses first.

[mldata.org](http://mldata.org/repository/data/) provides a repository with a lot of datasets that can be used for machine learning.

As part of the [Apache Spark Makers Build](http://apachespark.devpost.com/) hackathon a nice list of [public datasets](http://apachespark.devpost.com/details/resources#datasets) and city and regional public data (mostly US) is provided.

[awesome-public-datasets](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets) contains a huge list of links to various datasets. There is also a specific category for [machine learning](https://github.com/caesar0301/awesome-public-datasets#machine-learning) with datasets that are often used in machine learning samples.

I’ve also been pointed to some other websites that I still have to check out: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/), [datahub](https://datahub.io/dataset), [re3data.org](http://www.re3data.org/), [Open Access Directory](http://oad.simmons.edu/oadwiki/Main_Page), [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets).

One dataset I used for my first Spark applications is the [Stack Exchange Data Dump](https://archive.org/details/stackexchange) for the various StackExchange sites like StackOverflow ([download files](https://archive.org/download/stackexchange), [schema](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2677/database-schema-documentation-for-the-public-data-dump-and-sede)).
