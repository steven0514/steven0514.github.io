 I’ve updated the home page of my [blog](http://heidloff.net/) slightly. At the top there is now a list of links to recent publications about application development, IBM Connections and IBM SmartCloud.

 I don’t want to blog about these publications one by one. On Twitter, Facebook and other social networks my postings might get lost in streams or the social networks decide not to show them in the news streams at all. I’ll continue to use these social networks but you can find this information also on my blog now.

 Additionally this makes my blog look less stale. Since I blog mostly on [OpenNTF](http://openntf.org/main.nsf/blogsAll.xsp) and the [Social Business Toolkit](https://www.ibmdw.net/social/blog/) blog I don’t have much time to blog on my own blog.

 I’ve implemented this functionality via the [Collaboration Today](http://www.openntf.org/main.nsf/project.xsp?r=project/Collaboration%20Today) application from OpenNTF.
