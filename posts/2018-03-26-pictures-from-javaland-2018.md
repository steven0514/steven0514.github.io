Earlier this month I attended [JavaLand](https://www.javaland.eu/de/javaland-2018/) in Brühl, Germany. JavaLand took place for the fifth time and has grown to 1900 developers from 20 countries.

It’s always a lot of fun at JavaLand; this was the third time I attended. What was great this year was that we had even more developers visiting our booth than in previous years. Those who I talked to particularly appreciated IBM’s emphasize on open source and the huge progress we have made over the last few years in cloud-related technologies.

My colleague Holly Cummins gave the keynote. Unfortunately the room was too small for everyone to attend and when I arrived the doors were closed.

Here is a picture from our team Miriam Oglesby, Holly Cummins, Fernando Cejas and myself.

At the booth we demonstrated Anki Overdrive cars which are connected to the [IBM Watson IoT](http://ibm.biz/nheidloff) platform and can be steered via [Kinect]({{ "/article/anki-overdrive-cars-kinect-bluemix" | relative_url }}). The next picture shows Fernando giving a demo.
