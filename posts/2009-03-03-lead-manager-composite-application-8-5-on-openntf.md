 Jo Grant and Craig Wolpert from the ISV enablement team have posted another sample on OpenNTF. This sample is the rich client version of the sales lead manager application which has been implemented as composite application. It is basically the next version of the same sample which was hosted in the [Iris sandbox](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/sandbox.nsf/ByDate/b78f84905bad9098852572fe006afa67?OpenDocument). This new version has now been tested on Lotus Notes 8.5.

 In addition to the 8.5 testing a couple of new 8.5 composite application features can now be used. The application as currently posted doesnâ€™t use these features yet however. There is work going on to show how to use 1. sidebar, 2. live text and 3. generic web container with this application. Stay tuned for more.

 Get the sample from OpenNTF [here](http://www.openntf.org/projects/pmt.nsf/f56d5b5bd31be970862572a70053f5cd/62984fd45946a64f8625756e00644a06!OpenDocument).
