 For the IBM Bluemix Internet of Things hackathon at [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.co.uk/) in London, I open sourced another sample from my colleague Bryan Boyd. The sample extends the [Sphero Bluemix iOS](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/sphero-bluemix-ios) app. The new [project](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/sphero-bluemix-remotecontrol) contains a web application that allows remote controlling [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero/) balls over the internet. Additionally [Sphero chariots](http://store.gosphero.com/products/chariot) are used which carry iOS devices. The iOS devices can take series of pictures which are displayed in the web app. With these capabilities the balls and iOS devices can be steered without having to see the actual devices.

[Get the code from GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/sphero-bluemix-remotecontrol).
