 At the beginning of this week I attended [DNUG](http://dnug.de/DNUG/cms.nsf/id/36KonfAgenda.htm), the German Notes user group. I gave two sessions, one about the latest [OpenNTF projects](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/46217E5C98D647A1C12579B4005160AE?Open&dl=DE) and one about using [XPages in IBM Connections](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/9A523DE669719FB3C12579B8003A8B1C?Open&dl=DE).

 There were also two or three more technical in depth sessions about XPages but interestingly there were more sessions about how the XPages technology has been used in actual customer projects. One reason is that the DNUG (at least the spring event) is more business oriented than other conferences like Entwicklercamp. Another reason is simply that XPages is being used more and more by customers and partners.

 Here is a list of the XPages solutions sessions:   
[New intranet from RSGV](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/A17667733A137B3AC12579B8002D9752?Open&dl=DE) – Rheinischer Sparkassen- und Giroverband (RSGV)   
[CRM system](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/7C458BA55936D06EC12579B5005A6102?Open&dl=DE) – datenschutz nord GmbH, We4IT GmbH   
[Highlights from customer projects](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/48E2656C361C2046C12579B5005CBBF8?Open&dl=DE) – Whitecoast Solutions AG   
[Mobile XPages in internet portal](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/984204AE24309C64C12579B5005DE459?Open&dl=DE) – Dienstleistungszentrum Ländlicher Raum Rheinland-Pfalz, SIT GmbH   
[When to use XPages](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/386DD06394BF9622C12579B8002A1B6A?Open&dl=DE) – GFI Informationsdesign GmbH

 In addition to this the DNUG hosted a collaboration contest. The two winners both used XPages.   
[Social apps for enterprises](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/EFC896E6A05176A3C1257A0F0054D991?Open&dl=DE) – INTRANET Software &amp; Consulting GmbH   
[Portal for childcare](http://dnug.de/DNUG/dnugcms.nsf/id/6C1CC6E93364AAA3C1257A1C00356964?Open&dl=DE) – Bundeswehr, g.e.b.b. GmbH

 At the booths I also saw some nice XPages applications. One was a really nice and sophisticated group calendar. I’ll blog about this separately later.
