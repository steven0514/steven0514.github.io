 Below are some pictures I took this morning.

 Kevin Cavanaugh and Doug Cox talked about XPages and the [XWork Server](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/lotus/products/xwork/).

 They also talked about the success of [OpenNTF](http://www.openntf.org/).

 I think the most applause got the Notes browser plugin that allows running Notes apps in browsers unmodified.

 I also liked that Alistair Rennie mentioned the [IBM champions.](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/profiles/html/champadvancedSearch.do?champsearchname=ab.rc.cp.lu&champsearch=expertiseor&lang=en).
