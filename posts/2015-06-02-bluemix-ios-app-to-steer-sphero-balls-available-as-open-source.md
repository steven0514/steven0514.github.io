 Next month my colleagues and I from the IBM Emerging Technologies team will host an IBM Bluemix Internet of Things hackathon at [Devoxx](http://www.devoxx.co.uk/) in London. As part of this effort we’re open sourcing some of our IoT demos. Today we (thx to Mike Robertson and Bryan Boyd) open sourced an iOS app that communicates to [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero/) balls via bluetooth and to [Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/) via MQTT. It’s essentially the counterpart to the [Android app](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/sphero-bluemix-android) I published last week.

[Get the code from GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/sphero-bluemix-ios).
