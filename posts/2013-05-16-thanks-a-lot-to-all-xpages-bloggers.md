 There has been a lot of [XPages](http://www.collaborationtoday.info/ct.nsf/home.xsp?filter=xpages) blogging recently (again). As other people already noted, there seems to be a new trend of doing full series of blog entries about certain topics. Below is a list of some of these series.

 Amazing content. Great community. Thank you.

 **Source Control: The Good Stuff** (9 entries)

 Read the [introduction and overview](http://xpagetips.blogspot.de/2013/04/source-control-good-stuff.html).

 “Today I am launching a series of posts and videos to guide Domino Developers through using Mercurial Source Control in Domino Designer 9 starting with installation and ending with using source control across multiple databases and server environments. My goal is to get you to where I’ve gotten to with source control…but faster.”

 **EXTJS in XPages** (9 entries so far)

 Read the [overview](http://xomino.com/2013/02/24/extjs-in-xpages-the-grid-series/) and the [list](http://xomino.com/2013/05/13/extjs-in-xpages-9-infinite-scrolling-rebooted-and-reborn-v4-2-bufferedrenderer/) of entries.

 “For ever and a day it has been the dream of Lotus Notes developers to be able to modernize their notes client applications and provide their clients an interactive user interface which is similar enough to the notes view interface to seem “familiar” but it different and “cool” enough to help them make the decision to modernize. I believe EXTJS used correctly, provides that user experience and compelling business demands to upgrade.”

 **Dojo Data Grid** (17 entries so far)

 Read the [overview](http://xcellerant.net/2013/03/20/dojo-data-grid-series-overview/) and the [list](http://xcellerant.net/2013/05/13/dojo-data-grid-part-17-enhancedgrid-drag-and-drop/) of entries.

 “The Dojo Data Grid control is another option we have for displaying data in XPages. It provides a more modern look and the potential for much more functionality than a view panel, yet it functions in a way that’s a little more familiar to Notes client users in that it uses a scroll bar, rather than paging.”

 **Java for Selections** (6 entries so far)

 Read the [overview](http://www.intec.co.uk/java-for-selections-part-one-introduction/) and the [last](http://www.intec.co.uk/java-and-selections-part-six-value-picker-solution-continued/) of entry.

 “It’s no surprise that, despite coming from a background of minimal Java in the days before XPages, I now use Java as my main language in XPages back-end coding. There are a few areas where I’ve had to put my thinking cap on to work out how to use Java correctly when mapping between components and Domino, not least in number handling and Collections.”

 **XPages Masterclass** (4 entries)

 Read the [introduction and overview](http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/project.xsp?action=openDocument&name=xpages%20masterclass).

 “Follow the XPages Masterclass Video Series throughout 2013 where four series will be published covering various topic areas vital to building robust, performant XPages applications.”

 **Taking the scary out of Java in XPages** (3 entries)

 “The discussion following my last post made stark the need for greater availability of information that makes the nature of Java more accessible to Domino developers. Credit for the title of this post goes to Declan, who is considering writing a series of blog posts on this topic. I will be doing the same; hopefully there will be a fair amount of duplication.”

 **Getting To The Java Roots of XPages** (14 entries so far)

 Read the [overview](http://www.qtzar.com/getting-to-the-java-roots-of-xpages-part-1/) and the [last](http://www.qtzar.com/getting-to-the-java-roots-of-xpages-part-14/) of entry.

 “Now, Tim Tripcony is doing a series on taking the scary out of Java for XPages ( he stole my original title but that’s ok ) but Tim already knows Java where as I’m just starting down the road to Java. I have basic ( not the language ) knowledge of how some bits fit together and how to reference it from XPage applications but right now I’m like the majority of XPage developers and I use SSJS a lot so in this series I’m going to take you with me as I discover Java and Xpages and how it all fits together.”

 **Getting Started With Twitter Bootstrap** (3 entries so far)

 Read the [overview](http://www.socialbizug.org/blogs/articles/entry/getting_started_with_twitter_bootstrap_part_1?lang=en_us) and the [list](https://www.socialbizug.org/blogs/articles/entry/typeahead_and_tooltips_with_twitter_bootstrap_and_xpages?lang=en_us) of entries.

 “First off, what IS Twitter Bootstrap? Well, right on their front page they say it is a “Sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier Web development.” Okay, so what is it really? It’s a thing that provides stuff to make your XPages prettier. Too simplified? Okay. If you’ve been using OneUI in conjunction with the Application Layout control, it’s sort of like that. A tool that provides the bits and pieces to quickly and easily style your Web application with a modern look and feel.”

 **Creating Twitter Bootstrap Widgets** (1 entry so far)

 Read the first [entry](http://dominointerface.blogspot.dk/2013/05/creating-twitter-bootstrap-widgets-part.html).

 “In this five part series, I will walk you through the process of creating a Bootstrap widget by first understanding how Bootstrap widgets are structured, how to layout a widget, tie it together using Dojo, turn it into a responsive widget, and how to create it as a XPages custom control for you XPagers out there. There are three prerequisites to continue, you need to have a good understanding of CSS especially CSS3, you need to know Dojo, and have created Dojo classes using dojo.declare.”
