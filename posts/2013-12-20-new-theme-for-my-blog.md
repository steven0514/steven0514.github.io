 Iâ€™ve updated the theme of my blog. The previous baby blue theme was a little dated.

Amazing how easy this was with XPages and Bootstrap. I checked out some other blog platforms but I really prefer the maximal flexibility to change everything I want.

I also merged data from an older blog which used to be hosted on developerWorks in my current one.

All links should still work. Let me know if there are any issues.
