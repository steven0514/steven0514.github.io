 What a year for XPages, XPages developers and the community. Here is a quick summary of some of the highlights.

 IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.3 was [released](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/09272011023837AMNHE9T8.htm).

 IBM XWork Server was [released](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/introducing-ibm-xwork-server).

 IBM Lotus Domino 8.5.3 Upgrade Pack 1 was [released](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/blogs/social-media-marketing/entry/mobile_web_fortified_with_xpages_and_dojo12?lang=en).

 The [first OpenNTF XPages development contest](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/08222011023118AMNHE9NM.htm) was a huge success.

 The [second OpenNTF XPages development contest](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/12052011082506AMNHEHR9.htm) was a huge success.

 After two years of more than 20 percent [growth](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/NHEF-8CVBV9) the OpenNTF download numbers have grown this year again by double digits. There have been more than 350 new releases in 2011 which is basically one release per day.

[XSnippets](http://openntf.org/xsnippets) has been built by the community for the community.

[OpenNTF Inc.](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/BELT-8KB5JJ) has been founded and has 28 company members.

 XPages.info has 600 visitors per day who read especially the news. In the last year more than 800 news links have been posted.

 A lot of new training opportunities have come up, e.g. [Learn XPages Month](http://xpages.info/Internal/home.nsf/dx/Learn-XPages-Month). Following Twitter it feels like there is always some XPages training going on somewhere.

 More than 10 hours of [free XPages videos](http://xpages.info/videos) have been created this year.

 XPages has also been big at the different user groups. For Lotusphere 2012 there will be more than 30 XPages related sessions.

 The book [Mastering XPages](http://www.amazon.de/Mastering-XPages-Step-Step-Application/dp/0132486318) was published and three more books are being written.

 I really enjoyed this year to work on XPages, with my colleagues and with the community. Looking forward to 2012.
