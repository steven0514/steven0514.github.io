 Next week I’ll attend [CeBIT](http://www.cebit.de/home) in Hannover, Germany. I’ll work at the [booth](http://www-05.ibm.com/de/cebit/en/) to present [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/) and I’ll do two sessions (plus one repeat).

The sessions are part of the new [Developer World at CeBIT](http://developerworld.heise.de/en/) which is organized by CeBIT and heise.

“The Developer World at CeBIT 2015 is the new meeting point and marketplace for software developers. It combines a trade exhibition, networking areas and a stage for issue-specific talks. Complemented by an eclectic range of activities such as social evening events, the trade exhibition and the stages of heise Developer World will become the new centre of the industry. The new platform addresses companies with a focus on the development of software and Web applications, software architecture and analysis.”

Looking forward to meeting you at CeBIT.
