I’m happy that IBM will sponsor [JavaLand](http://www.javaland.eu/en/javaland-2015.html) which will take place from March 24th to March 26th. Not only are there great [sessions](https://www.doag.org/konferenz/konferenzplaner/b.php?id=483801&locS=1), but the event also sounds like a lot of fun. It will occur in the theme park [Phantasialand](http://www.phantasialand.de/en/home) in Cologne.

IBM will have a booth in the showcase where we’ll demonstrate IBM Bluemix and we’ll have several sessions. Ryan Baxter and I will attend the conference together with other colleagues.

The conference occurs for the second time. It’s organized by [Heise Medien Gruppe](http://www.heise.de/developer/meldung/JavaLand-2014-DOAG-und-Heise-kooperieren-bei-neuer-Java-Konferenz-1938836.html) and [DOAG](http://www.doag.org/). You can book [tickets](http://www.javaland.eu/en/registration/prices.html) on the JavaLand website.
