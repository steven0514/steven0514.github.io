 Recently I visited the IBM business partner [IT works unlimited](http://www.itwu.net/). They use the [XPages Mobile Controls](http://mobilecontrols.openntf.org/) from OpenNTF for some of their projects.

 One reference is the customer [KG Deutsche Gasrußwerke](http://www.gasruss.de/). Read the [success story](http://www.itwu.net/files/reference_Gasruss.pdf).

 IT works unlimited told me that the apps have been developed with the older version of the mobile controls from OpenNTF since the projects started before the newer version of the mobile controls in the extension library became available but they thought that the new version would have made it even easier for them.

 Additionally they have built a free app for iOS which can be downloaded from the [Apple app store](http://itunes.apple.com/de/app/itwu-launcher-free/id473961304?mt=8). This launcher app allows storing the Domino password locally (AES256 encrypted) so that users don’t have to log in for every mobile Domino app and iNotes.
