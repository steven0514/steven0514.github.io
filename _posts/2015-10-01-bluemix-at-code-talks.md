 This week my colleagues James Thomas, Jonathan Kaufman, Tristan Reckhaus and I attended [code.talks](https://www.codetalks.de/) in Hamburg, Germany. code.talks is a developer conference with 1500 attendees covering various topics around web application development. We presented [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/) at our booth and in a session. I enjoyed the conference and had a lot of great conversations with other developers. Below are some impressions.

 The conference was held in a cinema.

 My session [Docker in the cloud](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/rapid-application-development-in-the-cloud-and-on-premises-with-docker) was in a big room with a huge screen.

 We did two lotteries with GoPro cameras which were as always very popular and fun.
