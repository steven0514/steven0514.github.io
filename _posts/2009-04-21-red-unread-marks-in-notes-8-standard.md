 There are some Notes users who miss the good old red unread marks in Notes 8 Standard. Qian Liang from the Chinese IBM development lab has added another theme ‘classic mail’ to his OpenNTF component with which users can now see unread mails in red again.

In order to use it go to the [OpenNTF catalog](http://openntf.org/internal/ontfcatalog.nsf/Components.xsp) and the component ‘Notes Themes’. This sample can be installed via drag and drop into your Notes client..
