At IBM ConnectED 2015 IBM announced and previewed a new service for IBM Bluemix, called Social File Sharing. The service allows storing and sharing files in the cloud and it helps users to find relevant files via social metadata, for example likes, tags, comments and the number of downloads.

Watch the video for a quick overview.

The social file sharing service utilizes [IBM Connections Social Cloud](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-connections-social-cloud) which is an innovative set of collaborative and social services. When the file sharing service is created and bound to a Bluemix application, developers get their own Connections organization provisioned where they can create their own users and data.

The social file sharing service provides REST APIs and there is also a Java sample application called photo sharing that comes with some convenience functionality to invoke the APIs from Java. The application demonstrates the social capabilities of file sharing.
