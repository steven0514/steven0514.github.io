 This blog entry is redundant to the one on the [OpenNTF blog](http://planetlotus.org/53abec). I needed a place to store the movie. So I had to post it here and refer from OpenNTF to it

There is a [new project](http://openntf.org/Projects/pmt.nsf/ProjectLookup/Quick%20IM) on OpenNTF to initiate IM chats from selected text in Notes documents. Li Juan Gao from the IBM development lab in China has implemented it. As always it can be installed easily via drag and drop from the [catalog](http://www.openntf.org/catalogs/a2cat.nsf/topicThread.xsp?action=openDocument&documentId=13FE38DC865318D38525760800267CC1).

 This Eclipse plugin sample code shows how to perform three Sametime actions (1. chat. 2. show business card, 3. add to contacts) for selected text in a document in the Notes client.

 Just select either first and last name, a full Notes name or an internet email address in your Notes document, then right click and choose your action in the context menu as shown in the screenshot.

 Here is a [quick demonstration](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/quickim.htm/$file/quickim.htm "quickim.htm") how this works.
