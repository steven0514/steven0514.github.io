I’ve the pleasure to work in a team of awesome people in [IBM’s Emerging Technologies](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/ebusiness/jstart/) group. Below are two short videos of demos my colleagues [David Barnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbarnesibm) and [Mark VanderWiele](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/mark-vanderwiele/5/50a/548) have given recently that show some of the capabilities of [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net).

In the following video David demonstrates how to quickly deploy a chat application to Bluemix and how to connect to a [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/) ball based on content in the chat. He gave this demo at the [NY Tech Meetup](https://nytm.org/).

In the next video Mark demonstrates how to communicate to the same Sphero ball via speech recognition in the keynote of the [O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL055Epbe6d5aFJdvWNtTeg_UEHZEHdInE).
