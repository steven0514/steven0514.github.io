This week my colleagues Stephan Reimann and Thomas Südbroecker and I attended [data2day](https://www.data2day.de/) in Heidelberg. data2day is a technical conference for data scientists and developers focussed on topics related to big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Below are some pictures, most of them taken by Thomas.

We presented [TensorFlow Object Detection](https://github.com/nheidloff/object-detection-anki-overdrive-cars) at the booth. Anki Overdrive cars stop when obstacles are detected.
