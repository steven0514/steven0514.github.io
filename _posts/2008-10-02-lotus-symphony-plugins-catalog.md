Since Iâ€™ve written about different catalogs recently I wanted to mention one more. There is a public catalog of plugins for Lotus Symphony. Many of the plugins hosted there currently are also useful for Lotus Notes.

[Symphony plugins catalog](http://symphony.lotus.com/software/lotus/symphony/plugin.nsf/home)

In order to install these plugins in Lotus Notes you need to download the update sites and then install them via the [application management UI](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/blogs/page/CompApps?entry=installation_of_eclipse_features_in).
