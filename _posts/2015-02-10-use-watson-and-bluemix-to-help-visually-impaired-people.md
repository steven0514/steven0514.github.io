 Last weekend the [DeveloperWeek Hackathon](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=02092015060020AMNHEJF9.htm) took place where IBM hosted an [IBM Bluemix Challenge](http://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/developerweek-hackathon-ibm-bluemix-challenge). One of the winning projects was the project “Revealed” developed by [Dmitry Golyshev](https://twitter.com/@dmitrygolyshev) and [Kyoko Uchida](https://twitter.com/kplie).

 “Revealed is a web app that helps visually impaired people navigate better in the urban environments. By using visual recognition and text to speech IBM Bluemix technologies it recognizes the surrounding objects and read them aloud.”

 The screenshot shows the user interface on a mobile devices from where people can take pictures. Watson analysis the picture and reads the results.
