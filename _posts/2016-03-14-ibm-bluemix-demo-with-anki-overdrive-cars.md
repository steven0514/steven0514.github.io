Last week at JavaLand the Anki Overdrive demo was perceived pretty well and I’d like to demo it at other conferences this year as well. Obviously it’s much more impressive to see live demos with the actual devices, but if we won’t meet, I put together a deck with photos and screenshots and an architecture slide.
