 On Friday IBM published a new landing page on developerWorks for IBM Digital Experience developers which includes IBM WebSphere Portal, Web Content Manager, Web Experience Factory and more.

[developer.ibm.com/digexp](http://developer.ibm.com/digexp)

 Similarly to the [Social Business Toolkit](https://developer.ibm.com/social) community, the IBM Portal team uses the best of both worlds: IBM developerWorks and [OpenNTF](http://openntf.org/)/[GitHub](http://github.com/).

 A landing page for Portal developers is provided on developerWorks and the new IBM developerWorks infrastructure is used as the content management system. Open source samples are contributed to OpenNTF, the open source community for IBM Collaboration Solutions. The OpenNTF organization provides similarly to Apache an infrastructure to host open source projects as well as IP policies and processes to ensure maximal usage of these samples. Projects on OpenNTF can also leverage [GitHub](https://github.com/) as source control repository and system to manage issues and feature requests.

 Jonathan Booth and DeAnna Steiner describe in the [blog](https://www.ibmdw.net/digexp/2014/05/09/welcome-digital-experience-developers/) the mission of the new landing page.

 “Welcome to the newest place on the web for learning how to develop for IBM Digital Experience! We created this site especially for the growing technical community of developers that are working with the IBM Digital Experience products. … We’d like this site to be your first stop for developer resources. We’ll share the latest news from the IBM team, post articles on technical topics, and link to key resources. But our primary mission is to provide a central site for sample code and open source extensions for the Digital Experience products.”

 I like especially the integration of the open source projects from OpenNTF. So far there are ‘only’ two projects but the intent is to add more over time. The page which displays the [open source samples](https://www.ibmdw.net/digexp/samples-open-source/) leverages the new [OpenNTF API](http://openntf.org/main.nsf/blog.xsp?permaLink=NHEF-9HKBRV).

 A big thank you goes to Jonathan Booth, the driver of this effort, as well as the whole team DeAnna Steiner, Manish Aneja, Martin Lechleider, Jennifer Frischknecht and several more.
