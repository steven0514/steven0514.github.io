 When implementing new applications or new functionality I always try to use an existing piece of code as starting point that comes close to what I’m looking for. Even for simple functionality this has proven to be a good practice for me since I don’t loose time trying to find the right APIs and dependencies. Fortunately for [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/) developers many samples have been made available under open source licenses over the last months.

Most Bluemix samples have been posted to [GitHub](http://github.com/), e.g. generic [Bluemix samples](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix) or [Watson samples](https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud), but finding the ones you’re looking for can be a challenge. Below are the different options to find samples in addition to internet searches.

In the [documentation](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#) for every runtime and service there are links to available samples at the very top that showcase the functionality of the different services, e.g. the bluelist sample for the [iOS push service](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/#services/mobilepush/index.html#gettingstarted).

The website [bluemixdemo.com](http://bluemixdemo.com/) displays links to 150 samples. You can find samples by full text search, used service and language. From here the samples can be deployed easily via the [Bluemix Deploy Button](https://developer.ibm.com/devops-services/2015/02/18/share-code-new-deploy-bluemix-button/).

The [Bluemix Dev](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/documentation/sample-code/) page also lists some samples.

In addition to GitHub several projects have been posted on [IBM Bluemix DevOps](https://hub.jazz.net/explore/). You can find public Bluemix projects via [search](https://hub.jazz.net/explore/searchPage?text=bluemix&scope=public).

There is also a big number of [Bluemix tutorials](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/?sort_by=&show_abstract=true&show_all=&search_flag=&contentarea_by=All+Zones&search_by=bluemix&product_by=-1&topic_by=-1&industry_by=-1&type_by=All+Types&ibm-search=Search) on IBM developerWorks which come with sample code.
