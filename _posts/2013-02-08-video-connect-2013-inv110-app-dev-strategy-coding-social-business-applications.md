Here is another must watch video for developers from Connect 2013. It’s the session “App Dev Strategy – Coding Social Business Applications” from Phil Riand, with whom I’ve had the pleasure to work closely together for many years, and my new manager Mikael Orn. Great people, great content.

Abstract:  
The IBM Platform for Social Business enables developer’s to enhance business applications by leveraging the people and related information from social networks. Learn about the various ways to add social capabilities into your business processes and applications using the IBM Social Business Toolkit SDK. This session will lay out the strategy and then show you different ways to implement it. Come and see the new toolset in action whether you are a web, a Java, a Domino, or a Mobile developer.
