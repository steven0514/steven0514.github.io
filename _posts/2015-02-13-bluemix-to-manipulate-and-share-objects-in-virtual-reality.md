 Last weekend the [DeveloperWeek Hackathon](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=02092015060020AMNHEJF9.htm) took place where IBM hosted an [IBM Bluemix Challenge](http://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/developerweek-hackathon-ibm-bluemix-challenge). One of the winning projects was “CadSpace” which was developed by [Aria Sabeti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ariasabeti).

 “CadSpace enables you to manipulate objects in virtual reality, while sharing your vision in real-time with anyone in the world. One URL is all it takes to share visual ideas and get immediate feedback — no sharing large files that need complex software to view, no delays, no confusion.

 CadSpace uses [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net/) as the glue between the [Autodesk](https://twitter.com/adskdevnetwrk) View and Data API, and a Sphero toy as the interface. The prototype was originally built over a weekend. Its current state can be seen [live](http://etisab.github.io/cadspace).”

 The diagram shows the high level architecture.

 The [Sphero](http://www.gosphero.com/sphero-2-0/) ball is used as remote control using the [Bluemix Internet of Things](https://internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/).

 The VR device is basically just a smartphone displaying two pictures.

 This is an example of the two different views.
