Last week I attended [Hack.IAA](https://www.digitallife-campus.com/en/hack-iaa-2017), a hackathon with a focus on Artifical Intelligence and Car-2-X Communication organized by [DigitalLife@Daimler](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/digitalization/digitallife/). 60 students had 24 hours to come up with new business models and innovative solutions. IBM provided access to the IBM Cloud and Watson and helped participants with technical questions. I had great discussions with the students and enjoyed the event.

The students used some of the Watson services like [Visual Recognition](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/visual-recognition/) and [Conversation](https://www.ibm.com/watson/services/conversation/), technologies like Node, Node-RED and the Bluemix Delivery Pipeline for easy deployments and they got inspired by Internet of Things services like [Context Mapping](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/IotMapInsights/index.html). Below are some pictures.
