 Yesterday I attended [AdminCamp](http://admincamp.de/AC15/Agenda) which is a yearly conference for IBM Domino and IBM Connections administrators.

I gave the [opening session](http://www.admincamp.de/AC15/Track0Session2) about IBM Bluemix administration with a focus on [XPages](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/starters/xpages/index.html). Here are the slides.

At the end of my session I had planned to give the [selfie drone](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/drone-selfie) demo but because of network problems it only worked outside the main hall. I also hope to be able to use the newer Bebop drone soon since it has a much better image quality.
