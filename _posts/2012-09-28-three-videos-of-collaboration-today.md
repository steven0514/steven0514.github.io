David Leedy posted three videos about [Collaboration Today](http://collaborationtoday.info) as part of his [NotesIn9](http://notesin9.com/) series. Thanks a lot, David, for doing this and the nice introductions.

The first video describes the Collaboration Today functionality, both from a reader’s point of view and a moderator’s point of view.

In the second video I talk about how we’ve implemented the caching so that the site performs well.

The third video is about how we’ve developed the click counter needed for the ‘popular’ view.
