Recently Iâ€™ve read some interesting articles about Web APIs and how they open up new business opportunities. The resources below explain this much better than I can, but in summary the web has become more than surfing to pages via browsers. Instead web APIs often cause more traffic to sites than direct page visits.

An example is [Twitter](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2007/09/10/twitter-api-traffic-is-10x-twitters-site/). Twitter gets 10 times more traffic through APIs than the website. Another example is [Amazon](http://www.trinitude.com/web/2009/03/01/the-growth-of-open-apis-more-evidence-that-web-services-drive-network-effects-2/) who also get more traffic through their web services than the website.

programmableweb has among other things a directory of web APIs. The [growth of web APIs](http://blog.programmableweb.com/2012/02/06/5000-apis-facebook-google-and-twitter-are-changing-the-web/) is amazing. As of today they list 5339 APIs.

I like how Sam Ramji describes this new era in this great video:

I started to read two blogs where you can find a lot of more details about this topic. The [apigee blog](http://blog.apigee.com/) has not only great articles but also several webinars/videos. The other blog is the [programmableweb blog](http://blog.programmableweb.com/).

In order to consume these web APIs in XPages you can use the Social Enabler which comes with the [extension library](http://extlib.openntf.org/). There is a video showing the social enabler in action.
