 One of my favorite features in the public beta of IBM Notes and Domino 9.0 Social Edition is the embedded experience. As in IBM Connections 4 OpenSocial gadgets can be developed to embed custom applications. Additionally the [‘generic out of the box URL gadget’](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/20.11.2012100922NHECRE.htm) can be used to embed any web page.

 I’ve used this generic gadget in a simple sample to embed XPages in Notes and iNotes. The scenario below renders the XPages application Collaboration Today which allows anonymous access. I also created another example that requires authentication and single sign on works in both Notes and iNotes (via ltpa and account).
