At [code.talks](https://www.codetalks.de/) in Hamburg I gave a talk about microservices, [Eclipse MicroProfile](https://microprofile.io/) and Kubernetes.

In this session I used the [cloud-native-starter](https://github.com/ibm/cloud-native-starter) sample application which is available as open source. The [slides](https://github.com/IBM/cloud-native-starter/blob/master/documentation/FirstCloudNativeApplicationsJava.pdf) are in this repo as well.

The recording is now available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oabKnZO2mUA).
