 Yesterday we released a major update of the [XPages Extension Library](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/NHEF-8MQ963). As some of you might have read in my blog I’ve been involved with the implementation of a new feature that we call Social Enabler. It’s a new infrastructure which makes integrations of social services very easy.

 In this context I wrote a 50 pages documentation which I just uploaded to the Extension Library project. [Read the XPages Social Enabler documentation.](http://www.openntf.org/Projects/pmt.nsf/DA2F4D351A9F15B28625792D002D1F18/%24file/SocialEnabler111006.pdf).

 As I blogged earlier there is also a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAmgqP20Okw) about the Social Enabler.

 The other big new feature in the Extension Library are the new mobile controls for which I created a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0G6hZOocfi8) as well. In this video I used a database with as simple as possible samples which can easily be copied and modified. Today I’ve uploaded it to OpenNTF as well. [Download the Mobile Controls samples.](http://www.openntf.org/internal/home.nsf/release.xsp?documentId=9A3C4746DDB73BE98625792D00342B6B&action=openDocument)

 My colleague Paul Hannan created a [tutorial](http://www-10.lotus.com/ldd/ddwiki.nsf/dx/XPages_Mobile_Controls_Tutorial_) showing how to use the new mobile controls.

 Additionally a [new book](http://www.amazon.com/XPages-Extension-Library-step---step/dp/0132901811/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1318873794&sr=8-3) is being written about the Extension Library and I’m proud to be an author of one chapter. [Another book](http://www.amazon.com/XPages-Portable-Command-Guide-Application/dp/0132943050/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1318876865&sr=1-1-fkmr0) is being written about how to configure and monitor XPages.

 The new functionality social enabler and mobile controls can be used for the [OpenNTF XPages Development Contest](http://contest.openntf.org/). Submit your application and have a chance to win one of three iPads, iPhones or $800 voucher and a Lotusphere ticket for 2012.

 I also want to thank everyone who has voted for me. That’s very motivated. I’m now a director of the new [OpenNTF board](http://www.openntf.org/blogs/openntf.nsf/d6plinks/BELT-8MPMVZ).
