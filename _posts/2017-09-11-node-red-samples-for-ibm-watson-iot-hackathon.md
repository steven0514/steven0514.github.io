Recently I gave an one hour webinar to help developers to prepare for a hackathon related to [IBM Watson IoT](https://www.ibm.com/internet-of-things/). I demonstrated Node-RED and coded live some sample flows.

[Get the sample flows from GitHub.](https://github.com/nheidloff/node-red-watson-iot-samples)

Functionality:

- Getting started with the [Watson IoT Quickstart](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/#/)
- Using the [IoT Starter](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/internet-of-things-platform-starter)
- Building simple web user interfaces via the [Node-RED Dashboard](https://github.com/node-red/node-red-dashboard)
- Invoking REST APIs and implementing REST APIs
- Leveraging Watson services: Conversation, Translation, Tone Analyzer, Text to Speech

Here is a screenshot of the flows with Watson nodes.
