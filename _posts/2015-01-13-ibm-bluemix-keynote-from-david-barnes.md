Last October at [Pioneers Festival](http://pioneers.io/festival) my colleague [David Barnes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidbarnesibm) presented IBM Bluemix in the keynote. Awesome presentation. I hope to see a keynote from David live this year ðŸ™‚

David also created the famous [first Bluemix video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZR_jDitw0Sc) which has been viewed more than 30.000 times.
