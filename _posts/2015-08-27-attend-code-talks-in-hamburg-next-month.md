 On September 29th and 30th the developer conference [code.talks](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/uber-uns) will take place in the [Cinemaxx Hamburg](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/location). The organizers expect again 1500 participants who can learn about the latest trends in Java, JavaScript, PHP, Mobile and other popular technologies. Check out the conference [program](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm).

 IBM will [sponsor](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/sponsoren) the conference and there will be an [IBM Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/) booth. My colleagues and I will present and demonstrate Bluemix at the booth and would like to discuss with you cloud programming. The booth will be located between the entries of Saal 1.

 We’ll have not only great technology at our booth, but also vouchers for the beverages at the evening party on the first day. And even better we want to do two lotteries where you can win two [GoPro 4 Black](http://shop.gopro.com/EMEA/cameras/hero4-black/CHDHX-401.html) cameras. The first lottery will be on the first day at 16:50 and the second one on the second day at 12:45.

 On Tuesday at 14:00 o’clock I’ll give a session [Rapid Application Development in the Cloud and On-Premises with Docker](https://www.codetalks.de/2015/programm/rapid-application-development-in-the-cloud-and-on-premises-with-docker).   
 “With the availability of new platform stacks and new tools, the coding of applications has become a lot easier over the last years. However a key problem of software development often still occurs which is the challenge of rapid deployments in different environments – development, testing and production and both on-premises and cloud. The typical developers’ excuse “it works for me” doesn’t count anymore. Instead today developers are responsible for the complete development cycle up to the deployment and testing in production environments. Fortunately Docker addresses this challenge and makes it very easy to deploy applications in different environments. This empowers developers and allows them to be really innovative by focussing on writing code to go from concept to production in minutes rather than months. In this session we are going to use IBM Bluemix to get applications deployed to the cloud by leveraging the power and portability of Docker containers. We’ll talk about everything from build pipelines, to private registries, container monitoring and more.”

 Here are some impressions from last year.
