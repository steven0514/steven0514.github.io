 Yesterday we introduced [Bluemix.info, the news aggregator for Bluemix developers](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=03.12.2014123429NHEFL5.htm).

[Bluemix.info](http://www.bluemix.info/)

You can find the source code of this application now on [GitHub](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/news-aggregator). There are instructions how to set up the application in your local IDE and on Bluemix. Weâ€™re working on making this process easier.

Here is a screenshot of the Bluemix dashboard with the deployed application.
