This week my colleagues David Barnes, Ryan Baxter, James Thomas, Thomas BÃ¼ck, Timo Roeseler and I attended [JAX]({{ "/article/bluemix-jax-2016" | relative_url }}) in Mainz/Germany which was attended by 2000 people, mostly Java developers. There was a lot of interest in Bluemix and we enjoyed the discussions with developers. Below are some pictures from our booth, our sessions and prize draws.
