The IBM business partner [Highland Solutions](http://highlandsolutions.com/company) has developed a nice integration feature between IBM Connections and [SugarCRM](http://www.sugarcrm.com/) called [SemanticCRM](http://highlandsolutions.com/expertise/semanticcrm):

“… It transforms the customer relationship management system into a powerful search engine comprised of internal and external information. The intelligently classified information is triggered by related words or actions and pushed to the user as they create opportunities.”

Watch the [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJmTWO40GNw#t=03m38s) (3m 38s) to see the functionality in action. The SugarCRM web interface has been extended to display search results from IBM Connections files, profiles and communities. The searches are invoked when filling out opportunity forms so that sales people can find easily context related information stored in IBM Connections.
