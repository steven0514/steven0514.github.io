Last week I attended [WeAreDevelopers](https://events.wearedevelopers.com/), a large developer congress with 10.000 attendees. Below are some pictures.

Here is part of the IBM team: Youri Boehler, Emily Jiang, Harald Uebele, Thomas Südbröcker, Miriam Oglesby and myself.

Harald and I gave a session “How to develop your first cloud-native applications with Java” where we used our repo [cloud-native-starter](https://github.com/nheidloff/cloud-native-starter) for the demos. The [recording](https://youtu.be/ZIizxsmkWJo?t=6714) is available on YouTube. Here are some pictures from our talk (thanks Thomas).

It was awesome that so many people attended our talk! I guess between 1500 and 2000!

IBM’s Chief Developer Advocate Willie Tejada participated in a great panel “[Code and Response](https://callforcode.org/) – How to Save the World with Tech”.

Willie was interviewed after the panel from Stefan Pfeiffer.

I was amazed by the amount of people who came to our booth to talk with us about the IBM Cloud.
