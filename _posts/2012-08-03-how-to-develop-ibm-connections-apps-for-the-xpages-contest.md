OpenNTF [announced](http://contest.openntf.org) the fourth XPages development contest. I’m very happy that we managed to organize this one. Especially I want to thank the new sponsor [hedersoft](http://hedersoft.de).

This time we wanted to try something new. In one of the two categories we ask developers to provide Connections XPages integration samples. These can either be custom XPages apps that leverage Connections or extensions to Connections done for example via XPages iWidgets.

In order to make it as easy as possible for developers to get started with Connections we provide an image in the IBM SmartCloud. This image has Connections 3.0.1 and Domino 8.5.3 preinstalled and preconfigured. Plus the [sample](http://heidloff.net/home.nsf/dx/18.06.2012101730NHEBQZ.htm) I published on OpenNTF is installed and can be used as starting point.

If you want to use this image please contact me or DM @openntf and I will give you access. I’ve created a short video describing how to use the image and I also want to host an e-meeting later this month where I describe more details and where people can ask questions.
