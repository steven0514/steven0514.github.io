My colleague [Upkar Lidder](https://twitter.com/lidderupk) and I have discussed the topic Application Modernization in a [podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juCjyc98J5M).

The podcast is basically about my article [10 Reasons why Enterprises should modernize Applications]({{ "/article/ten-reasons-why-enterprises-should-modernize-applications/" | relative_url }}).

Thanks a lot, Upkar, for inviting me and giving me the chance to talk about this topic!
