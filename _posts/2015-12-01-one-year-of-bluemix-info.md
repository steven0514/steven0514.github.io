One year ago I [launched Bluemix.info]({{ "/article/03.12.2014123429NHEFL5.htm" | relative_url }}), a news aggregator for Bluemix developers. Over the last year I’ve published 1004 links to Bluemix related articles written by 279 people. Many Bluemix developers read Bluemix.info frequently, I’ve received a lot of positive feedback and the Bluemix feed was integrated in the official [Bluemix blog](https://developer.ibm.com/bluemix/blog/) site.

Since yesterday however Bluemix.info is not online anymore. There are multiple reasons for it. One reason is that there are other ways now to find Bluemix news. I created Bluemix.info because at that time it was hard to find all Bluemix related news published on different sites. Fortunately the [Bluemix Twitter stream](https://twitter.com/IBMBluemix) has become a really good tool to find Bluemix news.

I also built the news aggregator application to learn more about Bluemix. The application is still available as [open source](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/news-aggregator) and I documented some of the key techniques.
