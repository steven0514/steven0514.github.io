 [Giuseppe Grasso](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/mydeveloperworks/profiles/user/GiuseppeGrasso) invited me to this year’s [Dominopoint Days](http://www.dominopoint.it/Dominopoint/ddays2012.nsf/gd/Agenda-Dominopoint-Days-2012-) which I attended for the first time. It was a great event and I had a lot of fun. Thanks a lot to Giuseppe, Daniele Grillo and Claudio Meregalli for organizing it.

 This year the event wasn’t in a [castle](http://www.edbrill.com/ebrill/edbrill.nsf/dx/dominopoint-italy-conference-recap), but in the IBM forum in Milan which I really liked. I couldn’t attend most sessions since they were in Italian but I had great conversations between and after sessions and at the [OpenNTF booth](https://twitter.com/grassog/status/215796553309360128/photo/1).

 I was surprised that more people attended Dominopoint than the German user group DNUG in the previous week. For my [session](http://www.dominopoint.it/Dominopoint/ddays2012.nsf/gd/Apps--Apps--and-More-Apps--Meet-the-Very-Best-Open-Source-Apps-from-OpenNTF---The-2012-Edition-) this was very good since I had more than 100 attendees. Below are my slides.

 The only downside was that my flight back to Germany was canceled because of a strike. Thanks a lot to Sandra Bühler for explaining the route from Milan to Munich. Who needs a car navigator if you have a [map like this](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/dx/IMG_7442.JPG/$file/IMG_7442.JPG).
