 Last week [James Thomas](https://twitter.com/thomasj), [Jonathan Kaufman](https://twitter.com/kauffecup), [Soheel Chughtai](https://twitter.com/chughts), [Swati Goel](https://twitter.com/theswatigoel) and I attended [W-JAX](https://jax.de/wjax2015/) in Germany. W-JAX is a conference for enterprise developers with 1200 attendees with a packed agenda.

The quality of the sessions and speakers overall was great. Our team gave three sessions and there was a lot of interest in IBM Bluemix. Soheel Chughtai gave a [keynote](https://jax.de/wjax2015/sessions/application-services-learn) about IBM Watson and services in Bluemix.

I did a session about [Docker in the cloud and on-premises](https://jax.de/wjax2015/sessions/rapid-application-development-cloud-and-premises-docker) and James Thomas did a great session about [cloud native applications](https://jax.de/wjax2015/sessions/building-cloud-native-applications).

We had a lot of traffic at our booth and very good discussions with developers. The growing interest in cloud and Docker is amazing. Developers liked in particular our Bluemix dedicated and on-premises offerings. Below are some pictures from our booth and the GoPro lotteries.

The organization of the conference was very good again as earlier this year at [JAX](http://heidloff.net/nh/home.nsf/article.xsp?id=24.04.2015085153NHEA3G.htm). The conference was held in the Westin Grand hotel in Munich.
