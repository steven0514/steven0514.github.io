The [Anki Cozmo](https://www.anki.com/cozmo) robot can recognize [faces](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/generated/cozmo.faces.html) and [objects](http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs/generated/cozmo.objects.html) with markers like Cozmoâ€™s Power Cubes. Ansgar Schmidt and I have developed some sample code to allow Cozmo to recognize other types of objects via [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/).

Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhxItqxtfpU) and check out the [slides](https://www.slideshare.net/niklasheidloff/visual-recognition-with-anki-cozmo-and-tensorflow-84050740) to see how Cozmo can recognize three different toys:

[Get the source code from GitHub.](https://github.com/nheidloff/visual-recognition-for-cozmo-with-tensorflow)

The training is done via TensorFlow and a retrained MobileNet model on Kubernetes.

The classification is done via Tensorflow running in an [OpenWhisk](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/functions) function.

Ansgar and I have blogged about this project in more detail.

Enjoy !

If you want to run this demo, you can get an account on the [IBM Cloud](http://ibm.biz/nheidloff) and try OpenWhisk and Kubernetes.
