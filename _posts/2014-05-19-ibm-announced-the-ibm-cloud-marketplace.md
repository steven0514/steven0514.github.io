At IBM Impact 2014 IBM announced the [IBM Cloud marketplace](http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/us/en/marketplace.html). As Robert LeBlanc wrote in his [blog entry](http://asmarterplanet.com/blog/2014/04/cloud-marketplace-business-technology-meet.html) the marketplace “will be one of the primary channels through which we deliver IBM as a Service. In addition, we will collaborate with partners from our global ecosystem to deliver hundreds of cloud services for the enterprise.”

Watch the video for the announcement in the keynote.

IBM business partners can add their cloud based services. Read the [FAQ](https://marketplace.ibmcloud.com/help?1475681251#!/faqTab2) for details.

“Business partners are selected for inclusion in the IBM Cloud marketplace based on their ability to support enterprise class cloud solutions that complement IBM’s leadership in IaaS, PaaS, and Saas. As such, prospective business partners must offer services which run on or are deployable to SoftLayer, which integrate with IBM’s BlueMix or patterns PaaS technologies, or which support another of IBM’s key cloud offerings, including our many SaaS offerings.”
