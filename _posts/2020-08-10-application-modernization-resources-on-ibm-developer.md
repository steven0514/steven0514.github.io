In this short blog I list resources IBM provides around the topic ‘Application Modernization’ which is a topic that gets more and more important for companies as part of their journey to the cloud and their digital transformation strategy.

In my other article [10 Reasons why Enterprises should modernize Applications]({{ "/article/ten-reasons-why-enterprises-should-modernize-applications/" | relative_url }}) I describe why you want to use the following resources.

**Landing Page**

The best way to start learning about app modernization and IBM offerings is the IBM Garage page:

- [IBM Application Modernization Field Guide](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/content/field-guide/app-modernization-field-guide/?lnk=hm)
- [Application Modernization Architecture](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/application-modernization)
- [Recording of the webinar ‘Lowering costs through modernization’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWbnEn4UckA)

**Transformation Advisor**

Transformation Advisor is a tool that helps you access, analyse and modernize middleware based Java apps:

- [Local Cloud Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor?task=1/)
- [IBM Cloud Transformation Advisor](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/learn/ibm-transformation-advisor)
- [Demo showing how to modernize WebSphere app with Open Liberty](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/runtime-modernization-solution)
- [Demo showing how to move a WebSphere application to the cloud without code changes](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/op-modernization-solution)
- [Article describing how to get started with the Transformation Advisor]({{ "/article/modernizing-java-applications-with-ibms-transformation-advisor/" | relative_url }})
- [IBM Cloud Pak for Applications](https://developer.ibm.com/components/cloud-pak-for-applications/)

**WebSphere Application Server Migration Tools**

The migration toolkit provides Eclipse-based tools for WebSphere migration scenarios including Cloud migration, WebSphere version to version migration including WAS Liberty, and migration from third-party application servers.

The Migration Toolkit for Application Binaries provides a command line tool that quickly evaluates application binaries for rapid deployment on newer versions of WebSphere Application Server traditional or Liberty.

**Mono2Micro**

Mono2Micro is a new tool (currently available as beta) that helps converting monoliths into microservices:

- [Introduction](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/announcements/ibm-mono2micro)
- [Beta](https://epwt-www.mybluemix.net/software/support/trial/cst/welcomepage.wss?siteId=911&tabId=2156&w=1&_ga=2.2559152.1480675113.1597063629-616554282.1597063629)

**IBM Developer Resources**

Probably the best way to get started with app modernization is to learn how modern cloud native applications are written. IBM Developer provides articles, samples, tutorials and more:

- [Containers](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/containers/)
- [Java](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/java/)
- [DevOps](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/continuous-delivery/)
- [Code patterns](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/architectures/application-modernization/code-patterns)
- [Code pattern: Java EE application modernization with OpenShift](https://developer.ibm.com/technologies/java/patterns/jee-app-modernization-with-openshift)
