This week I had the pleasure to attend [W-JAX](http://jax.de) in Munich which is a conference for Java and enterprise developers with 1400 attendees. I’ve been to JAX and W-JAX several times and really like this conference. Great speakers, great content, great discussions. Below are some pictures.

The IBM team: Thomas Südbröcker, Andrea Overthun, Miriam Oglesby, Fernando Cejas, Miguel Crisanto, Christine Mayer, Steve Poole, Chris Ferries, Niklas Heidloff

Chris Ferris did a keynote [Who Pays for Open Source? A Case for Open Governance &amp; Enterprise Contributions](https://jax.de/digital-transformation-innovation/who-pays-for-open-source-a-case-for-open-governance-enterprise-contributions/). He also updated recently his article [IBM’s approach to open technology](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/cloud/library/cl-open-architecture-update/index.html) which is essentially a longer version of the keynote.

I gave a session [Development of AI Applications without Machine Learning Skills](https://jax.de/big-data-machine-learning/entwicklung-von-ai-applikationen-ohne-machine-learning-skills/) which was well attended and triggered very interesting discussions after that.

Steve Poole explained in this session [What’s new for Java in clouds](https://jax.de/core-java-jvm-languages/whats-new-for-java-in-the-cloud/) why IBM open sourced [OpenJ9](https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/) and how OpenJ9 has been optimized for dockerized Java microservices.

Fernando Cejas explained in his session [Reality’s Dark Side: Quantum and Monkeys](https://jax.de/big-data-machine-learning/realitys-dark-side-quantum-and-monkeys/) quantum computing and demonstrated [IBM’s quantum playground](https://quantumexperience.ng.bluemix.net/qx/tutorial)
