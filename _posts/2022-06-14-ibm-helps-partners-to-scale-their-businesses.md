IBM Build Labs helps IBM partners to scale their businesses and to reach new markets.

I am very proud that our team has produced two reference architectures to accomplish this:

- [Kubernetes Operators Reference Architecture](https://github.com/ibm/operator-sample-go)
- [Software as a Service (SaaS) Reference Architecture](https://github.com/IBM/multi-tenancy)

This short video gives you more context.
