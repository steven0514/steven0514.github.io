 We are happy to announce a new initiative – the Social Business Toolkit webinars.

 We’ve planned to host one or two webinars per month on various IBM Social Business Toolkit app dev related topics. Our intent is to deliver high quality content which is presented by various experts from the IBM development teams and potentially from people from the community. In the first 30 – 45 minutes the speakers do the actual presentations and the last 15 minutes are for open discussions.

 The webinars will usually be hosted live on the second and fourth Wednesday each month at 10:00 AM EST (US east cost). Additionally the sessions will be recorded and published on the IBM Social Business Toolkit YouTube channel.

 Attendance is free and no registration is required. You can attend the webinars by simply joining the following IBM SmartCloud meeting. The e-meeting supports audio broadcasting. In order to speak you need to dial in the conference separately.
