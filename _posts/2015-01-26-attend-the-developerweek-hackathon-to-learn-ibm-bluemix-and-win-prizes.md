On February 7th and 8th [DeveloperWeek](http://developerweek.com/hackathon/) will host a big hackathon for 1000 developers as a kick-off to the [DeveloperWeek](http://developerweek.com/) conference in the following week.

IBM will demonstrate [IBM Bluemix](http://bluemix.net) at the conference and will also host one of the challenges of the hackathon, called the [IBM Bluemix challenge](http://accelerate.im/challenges/74). Each member of the winning team will receive a LG G Watch Powered by Android Wear.

Maybe more importantly though weâ€™ll have a great team of mentors to help people to get started with IBM Bluemix and to advice with the implementation of specific project ideas. So this will be a great way for people to learn Bluemix.

The deck below describes more details.
