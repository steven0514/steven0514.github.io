This week I attended [OOP](http://www.oop-konferenz.de/oop2018.html) in Munich, Germany, which is a conference with 2300 attendees. My colleagues and I presented and demonstrated the [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/). Below are some pictures.

The IBM team:

One thing I really liked was a demo another company gave at their booth. They connected Anki Overdrive cars to an IoT platform to demonstrate how to prevent collisions. As it turned out they actually used my code which I [open sourced]({{ "/article/ibm-bluemix-anki-overdrive-cars" | relative_url }}) two years ago.
